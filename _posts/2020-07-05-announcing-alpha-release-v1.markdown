The core maintainers are pleased to announce the first pre-release of the CLTK's version 1.0. More information will follow, but at the highest level the guiding principles have been (a) to add a single pre-configured interface and (b) to fully rationalize software's architecture for adding new languages with a minimum of friction.

Preferably in a new virtual environment, in either Python 3.7 or 3.8, pull the latest "alpha" with:

> $ pip install --pre cltk

The docs should be enough to begin stress-testing the new code:

- Docs: <https://alpha.cltk.org>
- Source: <https://github.com/cltk/cltkv1> (Note: Not our main repo!)

For now, please open issues in this new development repo. In the coming weeks, we will merge the two Git trees together.
